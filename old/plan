DISTANCES
movement distance (how far players can move in a turn)
viewing distance (fog) must be greater than max movement distance
generation distance (begin proc gen) must be slightly greater than viewing distance
merge distance (merge pages) must be OVER twice the generation distance
divide/forget distance (divide pages/forget voxels) must be greater than merge distance such that jiggling cannot stress the server/clients
